A python program that displays periodic notifications.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, make sure you have the required Python package installed on your system. You can install it using `pip install plyer`:

2. In your terminal, navigate to the directory where 'notification.py' is located.

3. Run the program using the following command:

    python notification.py

This will start the program, and it will display a notification with the specified title and message every 3600s. You can stop the program by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.

# Customization

You can customize the program by modifying the following parts of the code:

`title`: Change the title to your suit.

`message` : Change the message displayed in the notification.

# Acknowledgments

This program uses the `plyer` package for cross-platform notifications.
